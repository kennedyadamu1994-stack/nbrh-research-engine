 * Genuinely random string of the given length from a 62-character
 * alphanumeric alphabet, using Node's crypto.randomBytes (never
 * Math.random(), which is not cryptographically secure and must never be
 * used for anything that functions as an access credential).
 *
 * Rejection sampling, not a plain `byte % alphabet.length`: 256 isn't
 * evenly divisible by 62, so a naive modulo would make alphabet
 * positions 0-7 come up slightly more often than 8-61 — a real, if
 * small, weakening of a value used as a security credential. The largest
 * multiple of 62 that fits in a byte is 62*4 = 248, so any byte >= 248
 * is discarded and redrawn.
